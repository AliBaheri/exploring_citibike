# Exploring CitiBike

Data analysis for post on my Data Science website. In this analysis I get CitiBke data from
the whole year of 2014 and build an interactive visualization of CitiBike station use, according
to trip counts and trip durations, on maps of the station network.

The complete code can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file in this [repo](exploring_citibike.ipynb).
