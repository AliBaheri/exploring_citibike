# Exploring CitiBike

Data analysis using Python for post on my Data Science website.

In the analysis I get CitiBike data from the whole year
of 2014 and build a visualization of CitiBike station use
(focusing on trip counts and trip durations). I use _Pandas_ for
data manipulation and _Folium_ to produce interactive maps of the
CitiBike station network.

The complete code can be found in the Jupyter Notebook (_.ipynb_)
[file](exploring_citibike.ipynb).
